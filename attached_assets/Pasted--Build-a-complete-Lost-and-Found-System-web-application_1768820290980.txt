ROUTING SETUP:
Configure react-router-dom with these routes:

/ → Home
/browse → Browse
/item/:id → ItemDetail
/report → ReportItem
/auth → Auth
/contact → Contact

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

All components should be functional components (use hooks)
Use useState for form inputs and local state
Use useNavigate for programmatic navigation
Use useParams to get item ID from URL
Add smooth scrolling: html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }
Make sure all images load from unsplash.com with proper dimensions
Add proper alt text for accessibility
Include hover states on all interactive elements
Add loading states for buttons
Form should reset after successful submission

VITE & TAILWIND CONFIGURATION:

Configure Tailwind to scan all .jsx files
Set up proper content paths in tailwind.config.js
Include Tailwind directives in index.css
Configure Vite for proper routing (add fallback for SPA)

STARTING INSTRUCTION:

Initialize Vite project with React template (NO TypeScript)
Install dependencies: tailwindcss, lucide-react, react-router-dom
Set up Tailwind CSS
Create folder structure
Build components in this order: Navbar, Footer, ItemCard, then pages
Test each page before moving to the next

WHAT NOT TO DO:
❌ Don't use TypeScript
❌ Don't create a real backend (use mock data only for now)
❌ Don't use CSS modules or styled-components
❌ Don't use class components
❌ Don't install unnecessary packages
SUCCESS CRITERIA:
✅ App runs without errors
✅ All pages are accessible and functional
✅ Responsive on mobile, tablet, and desktop
✅ Search and filter work correctly
✅ Forms validate and show success messages
✅ Navigation between pages works smoothly
✅ All images load properly
✅ Styling matches modern web design standards
Build this application step by step, ensuring each component works before proceeding to the next. Start with the project setup and basic structure, then build the UI components, and finally connect everything together with routing and state management.
